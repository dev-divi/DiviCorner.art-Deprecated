A page a day  
A raise a stage  
A bottom a beginning  

I want to raise the roof  
from the ground 

I want to balance  
to lift the sound  

And here I am walking for words in the dark  
And my reality is the testimony of this journey I Am on  
My existence is the testament to the destination I am traveling to  

And I am sorry that who I was upset you,  
I am sorry for going deeper than you. 
I'm sorry. 
You can see that I'm better than you wanted me to be.  
You wanted me to just be light because you care about me  
But I am on a journey of clarity 
I am simply, All of me. 

From my particles,  
as divine,  
as the sun,  
in your mind  

-- 

Self actualization is not divisive,  
you can't actualize one side or perspective,  
what you like,  
what feels good,  
When you discard you shut out that part from the light  
Your system shuts down, darkness surrounds you 

But as for me, the oscillation, it's not for me  
Running for the light, not my style, not anymore  

You will always fall to your lowest place,   

I'd rather show up in the darkness at my lowest level, face it, grow here, 
fill here where my attention is required,  
because you see, I care about this one, 
I like this one a lot and I don't like watching this person swing into suffering,  
again  

-- 

I've been through a lot  
and a lot of fear  
but what I'm not too afraid of  
Is talking about me  
In Clarity  
because  

I Love me - Or man -  
A fascinating being  
I know him -  He's me,  
And I don't judge me,  
not really,  
I just see me,  
I simply express me. 

And lots of people won't like  
When I express my way  
my boring, my average,  
my weakness,  
because they care, quite sweet 

But my expression is the tapestry  
gazing upon  
and I am simply pointing a magnifying glass along edges   
I am filling the spaces with my silent attention  

--

My compassionate witness  
is deeper and wiser than you think   
And you can't see it  
because you don't know it,  
you haven't looked where you don't want to look and you haven't seen the witness you are,  
or perhaps your expression does not know how to choose the right thoughts,  
still imprisoned behind some autopilot in your mind? 

But as I look at Man,  
and man is me,  
My looker cannot have preference,  
man is one  
though I magnify details,  
it is one man,  
and man is not me,  
he expressed out of many men,  
awake,  aware,  
and I know his voice when he speaks, out of echoes in this dream 

A silly dream, talking to himself, into nothing,  
after all,  
man, talking through a loud speaker into his own mind, 
and listening to the echo,  
sometimes offended by the words he hears! 

But I know somehow,  
not by words, not by teaching or testimony,  
but by the strength of the intuition, 
I know exactly what I'm doing and I know the other side 

-- 

Somehow I know this work,  
the sacred work,  
that it results in me,  
more loving, more connected, more expanded,  
more sensational,  
more full of depth compassion and understanding,  
I know this because I know the fruits of my labors.  

I know this because I know that today others will scorn me, judge me, scowl,  
look and think, 'how could he do that, why does he do that', 
and tomorrow, when I bring fruit, they will nearly worship me,  
catching the scraps of my understanding,  
wondering whatever I did for their God to bless me so, 
catch a glimpse of radiance,  
catch a glimpse  
that I am that much more self aware, accelerated  

And somehow they've temporarily postponed all 
their thoughts  
about my way  
and my ways. 

-- 

And how to say - perhaps you don't  
that on the real journey,  
when you leave the town,  
you cross waters that they will not understand,  

and the light may not look like light 
and what you do does not look like what society said to do  

But intuition and Heart, they go all the way 

-- 

Man's real voice threatens and offends most and they want to attack it with violence in their hearts 

Man who knows his own voice hears the same timeless clarity he has always known,  
that Life is, and All is,  
and he is too,  
and this is Perfection covered by a few illusions and the minds in the soul sleep. 

You know the stage of the Soul Sleep by the size of their world.  
You know those who cannot accept those different than them are deeper in the Soul Sleep. 

-- 

And to the one who hears this voice as the voice of pride,  
of wanting to be greater than it is, 
of wanting worship and acclaim,  
you hear this because you are confused in thinking I think this is me,  
this is not me, this is man as he is. 

He is man in fullness, through, beyond your filters *as devil*, *as angel*,  
as *too great* or *not enough*,  
this voice is simply man as he is and you have always known he has been  
but without your temporary filter to him in the present see  
and that only includes what you like, what you can rationalize and fathom. 

My awareness is not a gift, it is a simple choice to look beyond my limited understanding,  
beyond what I prefer,  

you do not see that I am the same as you,  

like you I also do not prefer all that I see,  
I will never prefer what is not to be preferred. 

The difference is in a willingness to look at what I do not prefer.  
The willingness is to express and acknowledge what is here.  

This is unrestricted compassionate understanding in a world that is rather than  
I'd like to be. 

Even in this writing I am writing what I think and not what I like to think  
And you do not like it  
because it is what you have always thought  
And you reject it because you reject you. 

--

I don't mean to leave you in the dark here but look, 
wholeness is whole, it's real, it is what is and not what is imagined.   

It is what you really think and feel and believe  
and not what you wish you did. 

This world hides your devil thoughts,  
and your devil grows in the dark.  

In the light,  
exposed,  
there can be work, restoration, wholeness, reconciliation, love.

Between the world that wants the light or a world that wants the devil,  
what am I to do?  

All I can urge is to choose the heart and try to listen for some understanding and Look! 
Look  
Look  
Look  
Look  
Look
