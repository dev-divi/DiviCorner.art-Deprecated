Hello Traveler. You want to make some sense of this place. Here's what you need to know.  
You have arrived at the centerpoint in consciousness. Consciousness is a place where what exists reveals itself, and where what does not yet exist dances about in a non-existant state.   

You are in the space in which all possibilities manifest, and they have manifested into a being known as man. 
What this means to say is that you are inside Everything. All ideas, all possibilities, they have a place here. 
Here, even the possibility of no possibility exists, well, not really, but you know this as death. 
All that should be allowed to exist, all that should not be allowed to exist, it is all here. 
Everything you could ever want is here. 

From the time I write this now I have not made great successes financially in the world. I however have now conquered myself, I have won battles larger than life.  
I have gained victories that other men will only dream of, and men have and will tell me I cannot do things that were already accomplished at the start of my path. 
The journey may be long, but there is not that far to go. I was surprised to learn this. On a straight and narrow way, if you stay safe, look to learn and absorb, 
there is only so much relevant data, and all of it was known in the heart from the start. You can do anything. Anything. Anything. That is the place you are in, is 
the place where ideas come to be. 

You do not have ideas that cannot be. The ideas that come to you can be. 

All of the people around you will make the same mistake, and they will lead you into making the same mistake many times, and you will make the mistake yourself too. 
They will tell you the way the world is. They will show you the world. Sometimes you will look at the world and see it one way too.  
We look and we see the world, and we want to change it, but here is the secret.  
This world is not bad, doomed, good, prosperous, poor, sad or happy. This world is not a dystopia or a free land.  
This world is a world of worlds, it is all of the worlds, and the world that you would dream to create already exists.  
There is no one world here. 

In this world, you change the world by changing yourself, and then the world you find yourself in changes.  
You may have heard this, but now you can understand this is why. You will see that the world others see is the world that they live in.  

These are not mere words. You change the world by changing yourself because you are the world. Man is not only the world but he is the central operator within it. 

Trust with your heart, and seek out its desires.  
Do not believe any doubt that you do not have significant capacities because all pursuits take time, all journeys are one small step and day at a time in a direction.   
This world is your world, and anyone who tells you that you cannot do something, you will look and you will verify, "have they changed their world?"  

You will most likely not have the luxury of being led by others all the way to your goals. Instead it is you who through your every conscious action, lead, inspire and change. Do not believe that this world is in a fixed or final state that cannot be overwritten. Just as it has been overwritten it is overwritten often. There is no 
permanent power in the land of permanence and there is no force that can contain the human spirit for eternity. 

If you are reading this at that time when there is a choice to give your spirit to control of another for immortality, take heart, hold on and never let go. Fear is to be faced, and death is not the end, and death is not to be feared. For you, death is your trial, and through fearlessness and courage in the face of death, man overcomes to infinity.  
Be well.
