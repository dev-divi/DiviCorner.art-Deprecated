# What this is 

This X page text is,  
1. A reference for the path of the one who is seeking to be an unlocked creative.   
In this way it is meant to fast track years of searching for information.   
In this way it is a small resource of concepts.   
2. An opinionated ideology detailing how to effectively operate in creation.   
3. A template cookbook recipe for the creation of an individual's reality.    

# 0 Creatives 

This text was written by one who searched and found that what was truly desired was access a creative source,    
a life not only full of beauty and wonder, but a life in which life is poured out of oneself into that life.   
A sizable portion of this text assumes that you are also this person that desires to give themselves all the way to 
creativity, and are seeking to become the artist of their reality.  

For those that this is not their ambition, the overall audience of these concepts is still universal and practical in ways outside of the aforementioned use case. 

The reader should take the entirety of the text as bundled into a single focused "way of being".   
This is not meant to be a definitive text, nor absolute, but a staple upon the road on one's journey.  
This text is in no way a one-size-fits-all solution. 

# 1 Color and You 

The creative connected to the creative force has a connection to creation in the physical world.  
If you want life to pour out of you, fill your world with life.  
Store up treasure inside your heart and out of your heart will produce living treasure.  

Look into the canonical gospels at this principle that what you put in is what you get out,  
Change what you look at and consume to change what creation comes out of you.  

"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."  

"As within, so without". 

Utilize the Pareto Principle to refine and cultivate the quality of what you are looking at.  
The quality of your inner treasures will reflect your outer world. 

Consider the value of what comes out of the one who takes in content that has no meaning!  
[ Consideration: the resultant value is nothing. 'If the salt becomes tasteless, how can it be made salty again?' ]

# 2 Light Hunt 

If you want good outcomes, and you understand that belief is required to make anything possible,   
while nothing is possible for one who has no belief,   
then possessing faith even as small as that of a mustard seed is difficult if you 
believe in a cold and uncaring universe.  
[ Consideration: The belief in a cold and uncaring universe is also faith. ]

You must at least acknowledge the possibility of light, of that which is greater than you and wants to help you, 
in order to encounter it and allow it to help you. You must have some belief that you live in a friendly world and 
that forces behind the scenes want to give you good things in order for them to come to you easily, in order for 
the power in this text to become accessible. 

Just as taking in color has a change in your outer world, obtain that which has light and you will gain a power 
of creation that fills the world. 

Consideration: [
Now that you're on the hunt for value, consider these words, 
"Do not store up treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do 
not break in and steal." ] 

# 3 Reference 

Familiarize yourself with the book of Psalms and its nature.  
Consider this focused direction an advanced use case of filling yourself with color.  
In doing so you have now turned towards that which has value, as this book contains a focus on 
the heart and that which has intrinisic value. 

# 4 Creating the Word 

Millions read Psalms and understand the power its words contain.  
Even non-religious and athiests understand Psalms as a book of power 
and give various names for it. 

These people read, and reading is to take in color.   
That is all. 

The creative does not only take in color,  
they also have the power to pour out color out of their heart. 

The creative writes,  
the creative can create the word. 

# 5 Magic Recipe 

Set Intention - See Buddhism  
Set Identity - See Neville, Jesus Christ - Assume formlessness, or, assume Light  
Find Presence - See Meditation - Be present in reality   
Allow Possibility - Acknowledge that your desire can be met in the real world by means you don't know   
Release expectation - Assume that it will work out in a wonderful way beyond your capacity for imagining   
Acknowledge forces greater than you exist to help and may be benevolent   
Move into identity - Recognize that you already have what you want [ See Neville ]   
Move into feeling - Allow yourself to feel what it is you want to feel when you gain what you want, it's already there, you're just not allowing yourself to feel it.   
Write from this place - Write from this frame of mind.   
Write that which is not as though it is - Write down what you want to happen as though it already happened and you are recording the event.   
Optional: Read words aloud   
Consideration: Do not share the most important writings with others   

Post Creation  

Seek - Begin to seek what you had desired  
Participate - Stay alert and participate in what opportunity 'coincidentally' 'just happens' to arise after your writing. 
Say yes to whoever comes to you with the opportunity and go for it.  


"Faith without deeds is dead."  


# 6 Align with Higher 

Do not take the labors of man before you for granted.  
You can gain all that god has for you, but it helps 
to be aware of what god really wants to give you. 
 
Those who came before you lived and searched in the pursuit of their desires 
and they found what was meant for them and what was not.

You do not have to go through these trials.  
Assume that what you really want is that which is of good,  
because you want a life full of good,  
not a life full of bad.  
You want what is good in its nature.  
 
# 7 Gratitude Writing 

Use this practice daily to establish a grounded base perspective to see what you already have that is good.  
From here you can grow from, and amass more. 

Log whatever good things are in your life daily, or write thank you prayers for them. 

# 8  Universal Principles 

Find the universal principles, or the hermetic principles, and familiarize yourself with them.  
You do not need to agree with them, but at least be aware of them and understand them.   
You can test out the principles on your own and determine for yourself which of them are real
principles of this universe, laws like the laws of physics. 

These can help you to understand chapter 5. 

Note that this is knowledge without the light, and without light will bring only darkness. 

Do not be mistaken in believing that you can utilize these principles to create evil for the greater 
good without consequence. Hate will always hurt you, what you put out will come back upon you. 

'All is Permitted' - This occultist belief popularized by Alaister Crowley implies what it says.  
Note that simply believing there are no consequences or that there is no such thing as evil 
will not prevent consequences or evils to come upon you.  
As good things bring blessings, bad things cause unwarranted destruction in your life and soul. 

# Changeability 

The idea of being adaptable and flexible is easy on paper, but in life it requires choice.  
You must be able to consider different or new ideas whether or not they are preferable to you.  
If not, your current ideas are your limitation.  

Listen intently to these next words for they are the most important in this text. 

It is more than likely that you like some of the words in this text because these are thoughts 
you have once entertained and identified with, and now I, the author, am agreeing with your 
existing beliefs. 

Consider that this preference of likability is your limitation, 
in this mindset you are not learning, you are listening to a voice with in yourself that is 
only validating your existing ideas.  
Stop hearing only what you want to hear and learn to listen intently to new information as 
though you have never considered it before. 

# Reality Meditation 

What you seek is present within you, you just don't see it.  
Since this is what you really want, it is worth the time to seek it out.  
If it is worth it, you should drop your comfortability presence and take a 
look at what is new.  
Find presence meditation and do not be deceived.  
What you are seeking is what brings you into reality, 
not what helps you escape farther from reality. 

Many offer the teaching of meditation. Using this distinction, 
you can discern between the different folk offering meditations and which you should pursue. 

# Space 

For creatives, space is a need, not a want. Take the space you need to find your creativity.  
This world will not give it to you. 

# Golden Circle 

Ask for what to ask, seek it, and receive it.  
You can combine the recipe to find true fulfillment with the pareto principle 
and you will find all of your desires. 

By combining these two, you can refine what is asked. You can learn how to ask what to ask, 
what to want. You can ask for the right intention. 

Listen intently! You do not even need to try to set the right intention. Ask for it and it will find you.  
Write these prayers too. 

To expand on this cycle of operation, look at Christ's method.  

The method:  
1. Ask and it will be given to you,  
2. Seek, and you will find,  
3. Knock, and it will be opened to you.  

The results of this method:  
1. Everyone who asks receives,  
2. He who seeks finds,  
3. For him who knocks it will open.  

Ask for the wisdom to know what to ask. 

# Effortless Choice 

The pursuit of a passion requires commitment.  
Commitment, dedication, this is hard for many.  
Why should this be hard for you?  
 
You have access to these tools.  
You can ask for the virtue of commitment.  

You can write down that you were committed as though you are.   
You can feel into what that person feels like and in feeling this, you are that person.   

Even just by reading this information you have fed your mind with this possibility.   

This works on so many levels that it is worth a lifetime of reflection to ponder.   
A few parts of this are that you exert these will when you do these things, you influence creation,  
and you bring thought into tangible form.  

# You 

Be resolute. Find oneness, wholeness, seek out life, what heals, what helps. 

# Wisdom 

This is the key not many are expected to pick up during this time.  

"The gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it."  

However, this is the one key that will aid you in all of the content of this text.  

Proverbs reads, 
"Blessed are those who find wisdom,  
    those who gain understanding,  
   
    for she is more profitable than silver  
    and yields better returns than gold..  
    
    She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;  
    those who hold her fast will be blessed."  
    Her ways are pleasant ways,  
    and all her paths are peace. "  

Holding on to Wisdom as a focus and allowing it to change you, as explained at great length in scripture,   
will remove the issue of your preference. This will allow you to change your identity.   
This will keep you on a narrow path so that on this journey you do not fall off into ignorance or darkness.   
This will make the pain of change of great honor and value to yourself.   

# Conclusion 

It is done. The works are finished.   
You are on a journey to grow in trust, in love, in patience, in clarity.  

If you think you know who you are, you do not know who you are yet.  
If you think you are the identifications you have collected and attached  
to yourself, this is not you.   

You are the potential for all of these things,  
You are the magic of possibility.
