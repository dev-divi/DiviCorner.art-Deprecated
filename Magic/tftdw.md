In your world is data, preprocessed and post processed  
Your mind processes all incoming data.  
Your waking aware mind has a chance to make choices about that data.  
Your background mind not only works to process this data but it also prints out a summary of that data in real life.  

In real life your mind's printing of your reality requires a great deal of energy and effort, so you the waking consciousness is given the reigns of decision making and processing.  
When you enter the sleep state, all that energy goes back to processing all of the information. Less energy is spent to output what the consciousness senses and experiences during this time, and the mind prints out a less definitive, less concrete reality for you to experience.  

This doesn't mean that the mind is the creator of the data or the reality.  
The mind only formats the reality in a way that it determines is what you want.   
It is intended to be your servant, and it is trying to please you,  
and it, like a simple robotic calculator, a powerful analytical machine,  
takes in your decisions about what you believe,   
what you choose in both your conscious mind and your heart,  
and it takes in what you focus on as what you want to see as output.   

In this model, the human consciousness never rests. It is always using 100% of its power and energy, redirected in different ways. The mind requires fuel,"food for thought" in order to operate efficiently,  
and in its prime effectiveness, as the machine was designed to be run,  
the conscious mind focuses on a healthy amount of problems to solve, considerations to consider, decisions to make.  
The mind is always reprocessing all information, all data it has ever received, every time it receives new input. All memories, the entire world, gets reprocessed.  
Just like a machine, if the conscious mind does not focus on new information for the background mind to process,  
the background mind will run out of food, out of fuel to burn, and it will begin to grind and suffer.  
If a person tries to become too still, all that is old will come into focus, and the background mind will begin to feed on itself in an unpleasant way.  

If the background mind is overloaded with new data, this plainly results in a breakdown, often a turning point in an individuals life, but can have varying and wild results.   
The conscious mind, you, being the ruler of the background mind [the background you], are the decision maker to determine what is.  
What is good, what is evil, what is light, what is dark,  
The background mind prompts us to answer with a a final decision on these choices, and then sorts that data into the appropriate category.   
This is its principle function, is sorting all of the data in your reality, and it asks for your input to proceed.   
This is where disasterous consequences for not participating in this relationship occur.   

The refusal or inability to consider an important concept, usually regarding the duality of man,   
prevents the background mind to being able to sort its data.   
When your mind presents you with the decision to decide if you believe,   
if you determine that Buddha is good or evil,   
if you refuse to make this determination, if you try to avoid making decisions on these considerations,   
you halt the processing and cause data regarding that subject to accumulate.   
This becomes the focus of the mind and reality.   
The longer you try to avoid answering the question, inputting your result, the more the unprocessed data builds.   

Unprocessed data in your consciousness when blocked will eventually first pour into your dreams,  
as well as in your waking reality.   
When this halt becomes longer and more drastic, what is presented to the conscious mind, what is printed out to you,   
will have more to do with the topic in question and further press you to make a consideration.   

A parallel phenomenon that can happen also has nothing to do with your decision making.   
You can also simply flood your mind [ or the mind of another ] with specific data until causing an overflow,   
and you can cause the background mind to print this data out into the target's reality.  
When done to others this is usually referred to as brainwashing techniques to break a target.  

In an individual's life, running from fear or the avoidance of choices about your own beliefs in morality are the equivalent of avoiding providing the necessary input to the machine in order for it to continue running.  

In this model, the individual's reality and dream states are containers to experience data and make choice.  
This is why decisions about free will and determinism can arise, when the person begins to sense that they do not seem to be in control of their life or reality, while at the same time being aware that they are influencing it in some way.   

The real way the person is influencing their reality is in their choices, which have varying levels of depth.  
This model can paint a picture that man is entirely in control of his reality, but this is not so.  
In this model, man has a degree of control over the output of his reality.  
In this model, the mind has control over the output of mans reality.   
The mind paints a picture of reality, but the mind is not the creator of reality.    
The mind only creates a filter from which to make sense of man's reality, in a way that he can experience through his senses.   

The mind does not create the input data, data that is not only coming into the mind but also changing.  
The mind is not creating others in the world. The data of the world is not created by the mind.  
The mind only formats that data in an understandable way.  
When you meet with another person, you visualize this person through one possible perspective of that person.  
You can look at the same person many different ways through many different filters and see many different people.  

Because you and your mind are not the creator of data that is outside of you, you can also encounter entities that are not of you,  
were you to focus on them and your mind to present them to you in your reality. By reorienting your focus, you can request that your mind  
show you God, or Love, or Light, or Satan, or other areas of existence that you did not manufacture, and some of these in their nature  
are so clear and true to what they are that your mind will not, cannot filter them down in an acceptable format to you.  

If you were to come in contact with anomalies like God, your mind would not be able to format, for example, God, in a way that is safe for you to see, your mind cannot trap god underneath all of its filters and bias' and beliefs that it gift wraps everything else in.  
You would see this or entity data as it is, in its full infiniteness beyond your capacity to understand or rationalize. 

This is because some entities are what they are and cannot be anything else. You cannot come in contact with an entity that is true evil and filter it down to an acceptable format, you will see it for what it is. You cannot come in contact with an angel of light and hide its radiance
under your filters. 

In your normal reality, you are able to conclude and determine what you believe and find a comfortability in a world you understand.   
It is in contact with anomalies outside of your usual world that you are not able to preferentially be the determinant of what is or is not real or what is or is not there. What is really real, unlike much of the data you process, is not determinant on what you have chosen to believe. 

In this model, ultimately we are given the ability to make our own considerations from a limited perspective, and we are granted a comfortable reality that supports our understanding, and this works reasonably well as long as we do not overload ourselves with a specific focus for perhaps religious reasons - unless we have decided that focus is what we aspire towards, consequences be damned -  or try to avoid the role of decision making - Believing that humans do not have responsibility over these decisions or that these decisions are inconsequential will unfortunately not relieve you of this role or diminish their effect. - There are many beliefs we are given control over that affect reality, but believing that your beliefs do not have weight will not cause your beliefs to not have weight. This is to say there is a base system that will continue to be as it is, indeterminant of your choice. The world you affect is the 'printed out' world, not the printer. 

There are however beliefs and understandings to explore that can help one to learn how to effectively operate the printer. 
While this text sounds high level and abstract, the basic takeaway is that in this model, your choices are the center and purpose of your current existence, your purpose is to make choices. The world around you is only for your comfort, it is an illusion that will continually redraw itself around you as you change. 
The other people around you that are also making these decisions are sharing this space. It can be felt intuitively that increasing their ability to make choices and decisions and think clearly is conducive for them, 
while giving them beliefs that would prohibit their freedom of choice or inhibit their ability to clearly see the options available to them can instinctively be felt to be harmful. 

We now live in a world with billions of people, many of these people are very powerful with a wide sphere of influence. This influence was not simply given. It is a result of manipulating this space to impose their beliefs and will upon others. When thinking clearly, we can tell that such an effort is in vain, because we remain only temporarily in this space and such comforts and power are not the purpose of this space. 

The freedom of this space does mean that one can recognize that it is fairly simple to use their power of choice to control anothers power of choice and effectively gain more power over the space. It's easy to recognize the consequences of such oppression because the influencer is not aware of their larger role in the world, they are focused on reallocating more power to themselves as an individual at the cost of oppressing others, slowing their growth or attempting to trap them completely. In our world today, people have imposed their will on others in ways that affect the lives of millions and billions. A decision to exploit a population by exposing it to a drug trade might affect countless lives that never had a chance because of the lack of choice taken from another. In this model, taking power for oneself with a decision usually results in the theft of anothers decision. The real crime is not in the miserable reality created for the victim, but in the removal of the victim's ability to make a conscious and aware decision.  

When a person is more aware, they can see that this is folly, reallocating power to oneelf helps no one, because from a higher viewpoint, we are more than a single individual. When we are more aware, connected to a more aware intelligence, we know that we should not prohibit our own growth or the growth of others of our own kind, other humans experiencing this choice making experience. 

The outright rejection of this system is also possible, though its results are disastrous and painful. Persons who choose this are often cognizant of the full damages and pains they will take on, aware to an extent what this system is and how it works, and have determined that they enjoy agony and torment and that they want nothing to do with the productive part of the system. These individuals have often been badly hurt by the system, by the consequences of others choices. 

This model paints a picture that our existence is comprised of a person that has the role of compartmentalizing and sorting data, 
and a world, Earth, is formed around the data in question. This makes a person the center of their own reality at all times, and their choices the central focal point of their reality. In this model, choosing if one should go to a party or stay home is not really about the party or staying home. Those events are merely placeholders, props on the stage, with the real merit being in the decision itself.
